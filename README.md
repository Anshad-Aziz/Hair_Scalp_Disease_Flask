Build an automated scalp hair inspection system that diagnoses 11 common 
scalp conditions. This model will leverage customized CNN model to ensure 
high performance across different user groups and conditions.  
To address variability in image quality, class distribution, and disease 
severity, we will apply advanced data pre-processing and augmentation 
techniques. These steps will standardize image input, reduce noise, and 
balance the dataset, ensuring that the model generalizes effectively to unseen 
data.  
  To integrate the trained model into a user-friendly interface, such as a 
mobile application, that can be easily used by healthcare professionals. The 
app will provide real-time predictions along with confidence scores, helping 
doctors make faster and more accurate decisions.
